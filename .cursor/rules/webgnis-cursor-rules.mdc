# Your rule content

- Always check for existing functionality before implementing new features - The codebase already has well-structured implementations (like the login function in users_api.php).
- Follow the established API structure with proper error responses using the returnResponse() function and consistent HTTP status codes.
- Maintain security practices like password hashing, JWT token validation, and proper input validation shown in the validateUserData() function.
- Preserve the database connection pattern using the connectDB() function from users_config.php.
- Follow existing coding conventions including:
    - Using prepared statements for all database operations
    - Comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks
    - Setting appropriate HTTP headers for CORS and content types
    - Using consistent function and variable naming
- Ensure backward compatibility with the existing JWT implementation and authentication flow.
- Maintain the existing project architecture where configuration is separated (users_config.php) from implementation logic (users_api.php).
