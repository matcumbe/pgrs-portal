# WebGNIS v0.1.3 Troubleshooting

## Explorer
### Filter/Search Panel
1. Filtering by location
	a. The filters does not cascade properly.
	b. The filtered points on the map/table remain as the subset available.
	c. Convoluted filtering system, maybe should be revisited again to be revamped or fixed when it comes to communicating with the API.
	d. Dropdowns should be dynamically updating based on the level of location (region, province, city/municipality, barangay).
	e. Dropdowns on the last level selected should display all options available on the level of location, but the next lower level should only display locations within the level higher.

## GCP Management
### Filter GCP Stations
1. Filtering by location
	a. Seems like the dropdown options are hardcoded into the HTML file in some cases.
	b. Dropdowns should be dynamically updating based on the level of location (region, province, city/municipality, barangay).
	c. Dropdowns on the last level selected should display all options available on the level of location, but the next lower level should only display locations within the level higher.
	d. Can also be a case of convoluted API requests and faulty referencing on HTML and JS script.

### Add/Edit GCP Station
#### Add
1. General
	a. Does not work.
2. Input dropdown issues similar with Edit tab. Check details on Edit tab

#### View
1. Double order category ("Order" & "Elevation Order").
2. Double description category ("Benchmark Description" & "Site Description")

#### Edit 
1. General
	a. Does not work or communicate well with the database.
1. "Station Code" form input
2. "Common" tab 
	a. Seems like options are hard-coded on HTML
	b. "Order" form input 
	c. Missing "Status" form input, maybe replace the redundant "Order" form input
3. "Vertical" tab
	a. Seems like options are hard-coded on HTML
	b. Duplicate "Authority" form input
4. "Horizontal" tab
	a. More specificity on the initial "Latitude" and "Longitude" fields on what they're asking for.
	b. Must also display the decimal lat/long.
	c. "ITRF Coordinates" fields must follow the initial "Lat." & "Long." fields.
4. "Location" tab
	a. "Province" input has "NCR - MANILA" and "NCR - MANILA, FIRST DISTRICT" options
		i. Might be an issue of delimiter issue in the database, or in API communication.
	b. "NCR - MANILA, FIRST DISTRICT" will display barangays that might not even be within the first district.
	c. Remove "Active Station" checkbox. Merge with "Status" input on "Common" tab.
